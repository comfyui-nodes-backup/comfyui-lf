# **LF Nodes (Legacy Repository)**  

🚨 **This repository is now in legacy mode** 🚨  

LF Nodes has officially **migrated** to its new dedicated repository: [LF Nodes](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-nodes). This repository will no longer receive **new updates, fixes, or features**.  

### **Notes:**

- **Last update:** 2025-02-11  
- **Status of the nodes at this date:** Fully functional.  
- **More info about the migration:** [See Discussion #145](https://github.com/lucafoscili/comfyui-lf/discussions/145)

## **📢 What Does This Mean?**  

- **❌ No further development** – This repo is now frozen at its last stable release.  
- **✅ New repository available** – Active development has moved to [**LF Nodes**](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-nodes).  
- **⚡ New Features & Improvements** – The new repo leverages [**LF Widgets**](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-widgets), a brand-new **web components library** designed for modularity and scalability.

## **📜 Archived Documentation**  

The original **README and documentation** for this repository have been moved to `/docs/legacy_README.md` for reference.  

---

## **💡 Why the Migration?**  

LF Nodes is evolving to provide:  

- A **better UI framework** with LF Widgets.  
- **Scalability & future-proofing** for upcoming ComfyUI features.  
- A **cleaner, more maintainable** codebase.  

---

## **🛠 What Now?**  

The migration process will take **some time**, as the codebase is **being adapted** to the new frontend library. **Follow the new repository for updates.**  

- **The same nodes will be available**, with names and functionalities largely unchanged.  
- **Frontend improvements** will make nodes **lighter and more modular.**  
- **Existing workflows remain functional in this repo**, but future features will only appear in the new LF Nodes.  

This repository will **stay accessible until migration is complete**. Once some time has passed **after the first stable release** of [LF Nodes](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-nodes), this repo will be **archived**.
